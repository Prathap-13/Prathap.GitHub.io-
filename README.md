Responsive Menu Layout
Responsive Menu Design: This project creates a menu with three sections (Chicken, Beef, Sushi) that adjust their layout dynamically for different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Efficient Grid System: Using a custom CSS grid, the sections are displayed in a row on desktops, adapt to two rows on tablets, and stack vertically for mobile devices, ensuring clarity and usability across all screen sizes.

Custom Styling: Each section has unique colors, borders, and typography for better visual distinction, while the layout remains consistent and user-friendly.
